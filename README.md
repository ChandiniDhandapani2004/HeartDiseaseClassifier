# HeartDiseaseClassifier

This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical input features such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and more. The model is trained using the Naive Bayes algorithm and deployed using Flask. Users can input their health data through a simple web form, and the app will display a prediction along with a health advisory message.
